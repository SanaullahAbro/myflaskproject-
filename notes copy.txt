It also defines the FLASK_APP environment variable in the env property 
to identify the startup file, which is app.py by default, but allows

 Note: If the env entry in your configuration contains "FLASK_APP":
  "${workspaceFolder}/app.py", change it to "FLASK_APP": "app.py" as shown above
  . Otherwise you may encounter error messages like "Cannot import module C" where C 
  is the drive letter where your project folder resides.

Note: Once launch.json is created, an Add Configuration button appears in the editor.
 That button displays a list of additional configurations to add to the beginning of
  the configuration list. (The Run > Add Configuration menu command does the same action.
  ).

Save launch.json (Ctrl+S). In the debug configuration dropdown list select the Python: 
Flask configuration.
